- remove the dependence of the LTE model from the lte-apps project. code dependence is in LtePdcpRrcBase

- use signal based statistics. In some places forwarded/dropped packets are counted inside a module.
  These can be replaced by simply emitting the given packet.

- In LteBinder parameters for QCI 3 4 and 6 7 seems to be swapped ???

- LteBinder: lteInternet is not checked for NULLness. Will crash if no lteInternet module present

- FeedbackTester should be moved to a separate directory.
