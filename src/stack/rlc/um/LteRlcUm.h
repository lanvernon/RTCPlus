 * @brief UM Module
 *
 * This is the UM Module of RLC.
 * It implements the unacknowledged mode (UM):
 *
 * - Unacknowledged mode (UM):
 *   This mode is used for data traffic. Packets arriving on
 *   this port have been already assigned a CID.
 *   UM implements fragmentation and reassembly of packets.
 *   To perform this task there is a TXBuffer module for
 *   every CID = <NODE_ID,LCID>. Fragments are created by the
 *   sender and reassembly is performed at the receiver by
 *   simply returning him the original packet.
 *   Traffic on this port is then forwarded on ports
 *
 *   UM mode attaches an header to the packet. The size
 *   of this header is fixed to 2 bytes.
