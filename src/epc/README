The purpose of this work is adding the user plane level to the EPC core network, i.e. creating and using GTP tunnels 
for supporting data flows, whether they are LTE-to-LTE or LTE-to-Internet and vice-versa.

Two new entities have been added
- TrafficFlowFilter: keeps a table for mapping IP 5-tuples into TFT (at the moment it uses only the Ip destination address). Receives traffic from non-Core 
  networks and associates it to a Traffic Flow Template
- gtp-user: keeps two tables, one for TFT->TEID mapping, and one for TEID->TEID mapping. 
  It can:
	* receive IP datagrams from the Traffic Flow Filter,
	* receive/send GTP-u packets from/to the TCP/IP stack (the UDP entity in our case)
	* send packet to the non-Core network   
	
The P-GW and eNB have both GTP-U and Traffic Flow Filter
The S-GW only has the GTP-U entity	


An Example of the path followed by Internet-to-LTE traffic is described here :
* A traffic source in the internet (SRC) creates an IP datagram and forwards it to the P-GW. 
* The P-GW reads the IP 5-tuple and appends to
the IP packet a Traffic Flow Template Identifier (TFT-ID). The TFT-ID is then mapped to a Tunnel Endpoint and a pair <TEID,nextHop> 
(Tunnel Endpoint Identifier) is obtained. The IP datagram is encapsulated within a GTP-U packet labeled with the TEID, and is then forwarded
to the nextHop.
* The S-GW receives a GTP-U packet, reads its TEID and performs a label swapping according to its local TEID Tables. From those tables it obtains
the nextHop and uses it for forwarding again the GTP-U packet
* The packet finally reaches the eNB, which reads the TEID, decapsualates the IP datagram and sends the packet to the proper UE (via a radio interface)
